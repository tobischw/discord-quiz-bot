    "explanation":"Manual configuration takes precedence. If the Router ID is not manually configured, the router will use the highest IP address configured on a loopback interface as the RID. If there is no loopback interface with an IP address, the router will use the highest IP address on a physical interface as the RID. If there is no physical interface with an IP address, the router will be unable to assign a RID and the OSPF process will be unable to start (see the error message below): %OSPF-4-NORTRID: OSPF process 1 failed to allocate unique router-id and cannot start"

    "question": "R1 learns four routes to destination 172.16.0.0/24 via dynamic routing protocols. Which route will be inserted into the routing table?",
    "options": ["EIGRP route: metric 1000", "EIGRP route: metric 100", "OSPF route: metric 10", "RIP route: metric 1"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "When a router learns multiple routes to the same destination via multiple routing protocols, it will use the Administrative Distance (AD) of the routing protocols to determine which route is superior (lower is superior). EIGRP’s default AD is 90, OSPF’s 110, and RIP’s 120, so EIGRP routes are considered superior to OSPF and RIP routes. However, R1 learned two routes via EIGRP, so it will use the metric of the routes to determine which is superior of the two (lower is superior). The metric in ‘B’ is lower than ‘A’, so ‘B’ is the correct answer."

    "options": ["Both of them", "192.168.0.0/24", "192.168.0.0/29", "Neither of them"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Although the network address of each destination is the same (192.168.0.0) and the 192.168.0.0/29 network is a subnet of the 192.168.0.0/24 network, because each has a different prefix length (/24 and /29) they are considered different destinations. So, both routes will be added to the routing table. AD and Metric are only used to select among routes to the same destination (ie. two routes to 192.168.0.0/24), not to select among routes to different destinations (192.168.0.0/24 and 192.168.0.0/29)."

    "options": ["NBAR", "DSCP", "PCP", "CoS"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "DSCP is a 6-byte field in the ToS (Type of Service) byte of the IPv4 header. It is used for QoS markings at Layer 3. NBAR (Network Based Application Recognition) is used to perform a 'deep packet inspection', examining contents beyond Layer 4 to identify the type of traffic. It is not used to mark packets. PCP and CoS refer to the same 3-bit field in the 802.1q tag, used for QoS markings at Layer 2."

    "question": "Which Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol port state is a combination of standard 802.1D STP's disabled, blocking and listening states?",
    "options": ["Blocking", "Discarding", "Learning", "Forwarding", "Listening"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) defines three port states, compared with 802.1D STP's five states. RSTP combines the disabled, blocking and listening states into a single port state known as discarding. The reason for the combination is because a port in a disabled, blocking or listening state doesn't differ from an STP topology perspective. Each of these states discards all frames and isn't actively learning the media access control (MAC) addresses of connected switches and devices."

    "question": "Host A receives a frame and discards it after determining it is corrupt. Which OSI layer checks frames for errors?",
    "options": ["Application", "Network", "Physical", "Data-link", "Frame Check Sequence", "Cyclic Redundancy Check"],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "The data-link layer is responsible for checking each received frame for errors. Every Ethernet frame includes the frame check sequence (FCS) or cyclic redundancy check value that is calculated by the host that sent the frame. The receiving host generates its own FCS value for every frame received and then compares it with the FCS included in the frame. If the FCS values match, the frame has arrived without any error. If the FCS values don't match, then the host assumes the frame has an error or is corrupt and, therefore, discards it.

    "question": "Identify which of the services below uses both TCP and UDP ports.",
    "options": ["FTP", "TFTP", "DNS", "SSH", "Telnet"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The DNS protocol is the only protocol of those listed above that uses both the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). UDP is the preferred transport protocol for DNS services because it is fast. UDP doesn't require a connection to be established between the hosts before sending any data. If a host fails to receive a response from a DNS server after several requests, it can then switch to TCP. TCP is slower, but more reliable, because it requires a three-way handshake to be established between the hosts before any data is sent."

    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "When two routers belong to the same autonomous system bearing the same AS number, they are considered internal BGP, or iBGP, neighbors. This also means the routes learned between these neighbors use the internal BGP administrative distance of 200, as opposed to the external AD of 20."

    "options": ["10", "4", "2", "2000"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "By default, the 802.1D path cost for a 10 Gbps link is 2 using the short 16-bit method. If you calculate the same link using the long 32-bit method, you get a default value of 2,000."

    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Each link to a switch -- switch port -- is a separate collision domain. In our diagram, we have two switches and a total of seven links. Hubs -- located in the lower left corner of the image -- do not create separate collision domains per link. That's because traffic entering one port exits all other ports. Routers, on the other hand, create separate broadcast domains, as broadcast packets do not propagate across them."

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The first step is to understand which switch will become the root switch. This is done via a process called the STP root bridge election process. According to this process, the switch with the lowest bridge ID will be elected as the root switch. In our network diagram, that's SwitchV2. As per STP protocol, SwitchV2 will have all ports set to STP designated. Ports Fa0/0 on SwitchV1 and SwitchV3 are used to reach the root switch and are, therefore, designated STP root ports. The last set of ports to examine is Fa0/24 on SwitchV1 and SwitchV3. Between these two, one port must be set to blocking mode in order to avoid creating a loop in our network, while the other will be set to forwarding mode. SwitchV1 wins because it has a lower MAC address, so SwitchV1 Fa0/24 is set to forwarding and becomes an STP-designated port, while SwitchV3 Fa0/24 turns to a blocking state.\nDetailed examples and analysis on STP, bridge election and STP port states can be found on Firewall.cx's STP section (http://www.firewall.cx/networking-topics/protocols/spanning-tree-protocol.html)."

    "answer": 4,
    "explanation": "The administrative distance is used by a router to determine which routing protocol to use if two or more protocols provide routing information for the same destination network. The smaller the administrative distance is, the higher the preference. Directly connected interfaces have an AD of 0 and are always preferred. Static routes have an AD of 1, while the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) has an AD of 90, and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) has an AD of 110."

    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "We begin by identifying to which network host 192.168.50.126 belongs. IP address 192.168.50.126 is the last usable address for network 192.168.50.64/26, which means it is directly connected to Router 3. Next, we need to identify where 192.168.50.5 is located. By examining the diagram, we can see IP 192.168.50.5 is Router 1's interface that connects directly with Router 2. Finally, to understand the path packets will take, we examine the output of Router 3's routing table and discover there are two equal cost links to network 192.168.50.4/30. So, EIGRP will load-balance between both paths."

Extended access lists offer additional options -- source address, destination address, wildcard mask, protocol and ports -- thus providing greater granularity. In both cases, it's important to remember access lists always use the wildcard mask, which is the reverse of a subnet mask"

    "explanation": "The example configuration will use the single IP address assigned to interface gi0/2. Any internal -- local -- IP that attempts to communicate with a device on the other side of gi0/2 will be translated to this single address. The router will maintain a NAT table for this connection. This table contains the local IP address of the internal device, the single IP to which it is translated and a unique TCP port number that is used to identify packets within that particular conversation."

    "explanation": "Adjusting the administrative distance so it is higher than a dynamically learned AD is known as a floating static route. Floating static routes are often used as a failover mechanism in the event the dynamically learned path fails. The proper syntax to change the AD is to simply type it at the end of the next-hop route. The distance can be set to anything between 1 and 255.
